            English as a Second Language
        </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          This program will teach you how to read, write, speak and listen to English. 
          Both children and adult students learn English, the benefit of ESL is that they can communicate with native-speaking friends and family within the community while reaching out to people who communicate only in English. ESL can bridge the gap between their families and the rest of the world. Classes are both offered for kids and adults no matter the level.

              Housing 
          </h3>
          <br>
          <p>
              Here at Hogar we aim to provide safe, secure, and affordable housing. We believe that housing is a human right. Housing affects almost everything. Research shows that not having a stable home can have enduring effects on families’ ability to obtain basic necessities (e.g., food, clothing, and medicine). Housing instability can lead to frequent school moves, and low test scores among children.
