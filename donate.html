             <p>
                People have to migrate for various reason such war, armed conflict, economic deprivation, and climate induced disasters. Thousands are placed in small, dingy, unsanitary, and cramped tents and containers in camps â€” and these people are considered the lucky ones because they at least have a stable roof over their heads. Some refugees, and asylum seekers even form informal camps outside official refugee camps in hopes of receiving some sort of housing. Others are forced to live and sleep in public parks, or even the streets.

                We are trying to do our best to ensure that immigrants and refugees develop a strong foundation to achiever their goals and transition to their permanent home,  but we need your support to continue our work. 

                Your donation can ensure that we can continue providing housing to the refugees that have called Duniya House and expand our programs to support even more people!
